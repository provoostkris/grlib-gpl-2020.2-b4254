# Introduction
The purpose is to add support for the LEON3 / LEON5 / NOELV in relative inexpensive hardware.
The aim is to target setups that cost less then 100 â‚¬ , and contain at least on CPU core
and some basic peripherals.
In addition an attempt is made to make use of common hardware. A normal laptop , running windows
and two USB ports, should be sufficient.


# Adding support for the Terrasic DE-10 kit
The DE10 nano specifications can be found on the website
https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=1046
A common usb<>serial board is added to support the debug interface.

## LEON3
Full tech support has been added for the cyclone 5 device. Design is based on the LEON3 minimal design.

## LEON5
Full tech support has been added for the cyclone 5 device. Design is based on the LEON5 - KC705 design

## NOELV
Full tech support has been added for the cyclone 5 device. Some libraries are modiefied to support quartus tools. Design is based on the LEON5 - VC707 design

A common usb<>serial board is added to support the debug interface.

## LEON3
The existing design was updated to use the serial debug link, such that more recent versions of the quartus tool can be used.

## LEON5
TBD - the cpu is likely to large to fit the FPGA 
## NOELV
TBD - the cpu is likely to large to fit the FPGA
