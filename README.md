# Introduction
The purpose is to add support for the LEON3 in relative inexpensive hardware.
The aim is to target setups that cost less then 100 â‚¬ , and contain at least on CPU core
and some basic peripherals.
In addition an attempt is made to make use of common hardware. A normal laptop , running windows
and two USB ports, should be sufficient.
